The [glossary](./glossary.md) is intended to be a starting point for agreeing on shared vocabulary and term usage.

We are doing a first pass at defining terms at the Tech meeting on 2/18/2020, however terms and definitons can be added and refined by the tech team on an ongoing basis until 5/1/2020. At that point, the current glossary will be submitted using the RFC process, so an official version 1 can be published. New terms and refinements will then be discussed here, to be added at some interval by RFC.
