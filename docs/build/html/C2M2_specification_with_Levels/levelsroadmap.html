<h1>The Common Fund Data Ecosystem’s Crosscut Metadata Model (CFDE C2M2) Roadmap<a class="headerlink" href="#the-common-fund-data-ecosystem-s-crosscut-metadata-model-cfde-c2m2-roadmap" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This document introduces the Crosscut Metadata Model (C2M2)],
a flexible standard for describing biomedical experimental
data. The Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) group is creating a new
infrastructure, with C2M2 as its central concept, through
which powerful cross-dataset searches, custom aggregation
of experimental data and scale-powered statistical analysis
methods will be made possible for the biomedical research
community at an unprecedented scope.</p>
<p>Using this new infrastructure, the data coordinating centers
(<a class="reference external" href="./glossary.html#dcc">DCCs</a>) can
share structured information (<a class="reference external" href="./glossary.html#metadata">metadata</a>)
about their experimental resources with the research
community, dramatically widening access to usable
observational data and accelerating discovery.</p>
<div class="section" id="dcc-metadata-submissions">
<h2>DCC Metadata Submissions<a class="headerlink" href="#dcc-metadata-submissions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The DCCs will collect and provide metadata to CFDE describing
experimental resources within their purview. Each metadata
submission will take the form of a collection of tab-separated value (TSV)
files. Precise formatting requirements for these TSV
collections will be specified by JSON schema documents
implementing the <a class="reference external" href="http://frictionlessdata.io/docs/data-package/">Data Package</a>
meta-specification published by the <a class="reference external" href="http://frictionlessdata.io/">Frictionless Data</a>
group. These schemas will be used by the CFDE software
infrastructure to automatically validate submission format compliance
and metadata integrity during the <a class="reference external" href="./glossary.html#metadata-ingest">metadata ingestion</a> process.</p>
<p>The CFDE will offer the DCCs multiple alternatives for metadata submission
formats, all of which will be automatically interoperable with the
C2M2 ecosystem. These alternative formats are arranged in
levels, tiered according to increasing complexity and reflecting
anticipated differences in the relative richness of metadata
available to different DCCs at any time. The general
expectation will be that the metadata submitted and managed by a
DCC will be able to transition, over time, through
increasingly rich modeling levels as the life cycle of DCC/CFDE technical interaction
progresses, which will enable increasingly powerful downstream
applications.</p>

<div class="section" id="c2m2-richness-levels">
<h2>C2M2 Richness Levels<a class="headerlink" href="#c2m2-richness-levels" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In its <a class="reference external" href="./C2M2_ER_diagrams/README.html#full-c2m2-er-model">current form</a>,
C2M2 is an <a class="reference external" href="./glossary.html#entity-relationship-model">entity-relationship system</a>
that models common properties of resources fundamental
to biomedical research like <a class="reference external" href="./glossary.html#subject">subjects</a>, <a class="reference external" href="./glossary.html#digital-file-assets">digital files</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="./glossary.html#event">events</a>, <a class="reference external" href="./glossary.html#biospecimen">biospecimens</a>, and project <a class="reference external" href="./glossary.html#dataset">datasets</a>. Essential
relationships between these fundamental resources are also formally described,
documenting, for example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>the samples that were processed to produce a particular data file</p></li>
<li><p>which subject a given sample was drawn from (possibly obfuscated to protect patient privacy)</p></li>
<li><p>when a particular blood pressure measurement was made</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While we know our current model is not yet rich enough to contain
all the metadata that will be required by all DCCs, there are also too many terms
for most DCCs to easily use. Modeling and data wrangling are always difficult, even for
experts. Requiring every DCC to model their metadata using
all possible features of the <a class="reference external" href="./C2M2_ER_diagrams/README.html#full-c2m2-er-model">current C2M2 model</a>
as a precondition for submitting metadata to CFDE would
be impractical for several important reasons.</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Many of the DCCs host human data, and for all but very basic file information, the
associated metadata is protected. Currently, the CFDE does not have protected
data access or a permission to make these metadata searchable. Requiring
DCCs to supply these terms would make it illegal for most DCCs to comply.</p></li>
<li><p>From an operational standpoint, the C2M2 model must remain as flexible as possible, especially
during its developmental phases, to accommodate mutual learning
between the DCCs and CFDE as the process of data ingestion
develops. We do not want to lock ourselves in to our current
model topology before we begin adding real data.
It is far more expensive and error-prone to
repeatedly change a complex model than it is to build
one gradually from a simpler core concept that can stabilize before more specialized branches are added.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if
the issues with protected metadata were solved and the model was perfected, the
complexity of the overall model would create avoidable and unnecessary onboarding delays
for any new DCC.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>With the design of C2M2, we are splitting the difference
between the ease of evolution inherent in a simple model and
the operational power provided to downstream applications by more
complicated and difficult-to-maintain frameworks.
DCCs with advanced, operationalized metadata modeling
systems of their own should not encounter arbitrary
barriers to CFDE support for more extensive relational
modeling of their metadata if they want it; CFDE will
maintain such support by iteratively refining the
<a class="reference external" href="./C2M2_ER_diagrams/README.html#full-c2m2-er-model">current C2M2 model</a>
according to needs identified while working with
more operationally advanced DCCs.</p>
<p>Newer or smaller DCCs, by contrast, may
not currently have enough readily-available information
to describe their experimental resources using the
most complex C2M2 modeling level. The CFDE will support
cases like these by offering simpler but still well-structured
metadata levels, lowering some of the barriers to rapid
entry into the data ecosystem. We expect this concept of levels to
be useful even after all current DCCs are onboarded: when the Common Fund funds new
programs, they will all have ramp up phases where their data is
less rich than the more mature DCCs.</p>
<p>Simpler C2M2 metadata levels must be maintained by the
CFDE to maximize interoperability with
more complex C2M2 variants; the whole system should be
structured to minimize the negative side effects of overall model
changes. These considerations have led to the
creation of C2M2 <a class="reference external" href="./glossary.html#richness-levels">richness levels</a>:
concentric, canonical subsets of C2M2 that are benchmarked at
increasing levels of model complexity and detail, wherein each successive
modeling level is a value-added superset of all of the metadata
encompassed by the previous (less complex) level.</p>
<p>Presently, the CFDE offers two less complex C2M2 variants
in addition to the most complex, current C2M2 model:
<a class="reference external" href="./C2M2_ER_diagrams/README.html#level-0-c2m2-er-model">Level 0</a> (basic metadata describing a collection of digital files) and
<a class="reference external" href="./C2M2_ER_diagrams/README.html#level-1-c2m2-er-model">Level 1</a>. Level 1 accomplishes the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Introduces terms for core experimental resources, like samples and subjects.</p></li>
<li><p>Provides a rudimentary set of search targets in the form of annotations, like the anatomical location of the source for a human tissue sample or taxonomic data describing sample source organisms and study subjects.</p></li>
<li><p>Supports arranging experimental resources into sub-collections based on a hierarchy of projects, studies, or other similar subdivisions of research ownership and responsibility.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Levels 0 and 1 consist entirely of unprotected
metadata terms, and therefore should be achievable by all DCCs. These two levels are sufficient to support two minimal <a class="reference external" href="https://nih-cfde.github.io/usecases/">Use Cases</a>.
Using only the metadata from Levels 1 and 2, <a class="reference external" href="https://nih-cfde.github.io/usecases/use-cases/browse-and-filter.html">a researcher can find datasets</a> from across the Common Fund that contain information about her tissue of interest, assayed using her method of choice. Similarly, <a class="reference external" href="https://nih-cfde.github.io/usecases/use-cases/multi-compare-custodian.html">staff at the NIH can compare the tissues, species and assay types available across DCCs</a>. More complex Use Cases, such as the <a class="reference external" href="https://nih-cfde.github.io/usecases/use-cases/browse-and-filter-complex.html">ability for a researcher to find datasets for patients with a specific disease in a specific age range</a> will require the DCCs to submit Level 2, protected, metadata terms. However, this is limited by our access to protected data, as we cannot legally accept that data until certain security and administrative issues are solved.</p>

<h3>(Level N)<a class="headerlink" href="#level-n" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Based on feedback from the DCCs, and the terms that are important for searching their data, we anticipate the
need for further levels. Until we begin receiving metadata from the programs, we cannot predict
what terms will be added or what constellations of terms will be required to make a compliant model. However,
we do not expect the number of levels to exceed 5, as some new terms will best fit as amendments to previously defined levels.</p>
<p>The full specification is expected, but not outlined or under active development. It will be outlined once the DCCs begin to submit data and formalized in collaboration with our DCC partners. As with Level 2, implementation of these levels will be dependent on CFDE access to protected data.</p>
