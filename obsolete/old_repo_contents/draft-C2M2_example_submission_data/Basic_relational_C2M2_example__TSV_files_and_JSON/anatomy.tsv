UBERON:0004264	lower leg skin	A zone of skin that is part of a lower leg [Automatically generated definition].
UBERON:0008878	palmar part of manus	
UBERON:0000165	mouth	The proximal portion of the digestive tract, containing the oral cavity and bounded by the oral opening. In vertebrates, this extends to the pharynx and includes gums, lips, tongue and parts of the palate. Typically also includes the teeth, except where these occur elsewhere (e.g. pharyngeal jaws) or protrude from the mouth (tusks).
UBERON:0012336	perianal skin	A zone of skin that is part of the area surrounding the anus.
UBERON:0012317	vagina orifice	The median slit located inferior and posterior to the external urethral orifice in the female; the exit for menstrual flow and birth and the entrance for the penis during sexual intercourse; the size and appearance of the vaginal orifice varies inversely with that of the hymen (G. membrane), a thin fold of mucous membrane that surrounds the vaginal orifice
UBERON:0000057	urethra	the fibromuscular tubular canal through which urine is discharged from the bladder to the exterior via the external urinary meatus; in males, the urethra is joined by the ejaculatory ducts and serves as a passageway for semen during ejaculation, as well as a canal for urine during voiding; in females, the urethra is shorter and emerges above the vaginal opening
UBERON:0000004	nose	The olfactory organ of vertebrates, consisting of nares, olfactory epithelia and the structures and skeletal framework of the nasal cavity.
UBERON:0001728	nasopharynx	the section of the pharynx that lies above the soft palate
UBERON:0002398	manus	distal segment of the fore limb, including carpal region, metacarpal region and digits.
UBERON:0004262	upper leg skin	A zone of skin that is part of a hindlimb stylopod [Automatically generated definition].
UBERON:0009471	dorsum of tongue	The superior surface of the tongue divided by the sulcus terminalis into an anterior two-thirds, the presulcal part (pars presulcalis). and a posterior one-third, the postsulcal part (pars postsulcalis).
UBERON:0003216	hard palate	Anterior portion of the palate consisting of bone and mucous membranes[GO]. The hard palate is formed from bony processes of the maxilla, premaxilla and palatine[Kardong].
UBERON:0006956	buccal mucosa	The inner lining of the cheeks and lips.
UBERON:0001828	gingiva	The fibrous investing tissue, covered by keratinized epithelium, that immediately surrounds a tooth and is contiguous with its periodontal ligament and with the mucosal tissues of the mouth[Glossary of Periodontal Terms 2001].
UBERON:0002373	palatine tonsil	tonsils on the left and right sides at the back of the throat. one of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALT), located at the entrance to the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts to protect the body from the entry of exogenous material through mucosal sites[WP].
UBERON:0000341	throat	In anatomy, the throat is the anterior part of the neck, in front of the vertebral column. It consists of the pharynx and larynx. An important feature of the throat is the epiglottis, a flap which separates the esophagus from the trachea and prevents inhalation of food or drink. The throat contains various blood vessels, various pharyngeal muscles, the trachea (windpipe) and the esophagus. The hyoid bone and the clavicle are the only bones located in the throat of mammals. It is sometimes considered a synonym for fauces. [WP,unvetted].
UBERON:0005928	external naris	A naris that provides one of the small external openings of the head that give passage to air for breathing.
UBERON:0016486	posterior fornix of vagina	The vaginal fornix that is behind the cervix. It is close to the recto-uterine pouch.
UBERON:0000167	oral cavity	Anatomical cavity at the start of the digestive tract that that is enclosed by the mouth. The boundaries and contents vary depending on the species. In vertebrates, the boundaries are the oral opening, the cheeks, the palate and (if present) the palatoglossal arch - if this is not present then the mouth and pharynx form the oropharyngeal cavity. The buccal cavity contains the teeth, tongue and palate (when present)
UBERON:0000178	blood	A fluid that is composed of blood plasma and erythrocytes.
