OBI:0000489	nitrogen phosphorous detector	The nitrogen phosphorus detector (NPD) (sometimes called the thermionic detector) is a very sensitive, specific detector the design of which, is based on the FID. Physically the sensor appears to be very similar to the FID but, in fact, operates on an entirely different principle. The nitrogen phosphorous detector (sometimes called the thermionic detector) is a very sensitive but specific detector that responds almost exclusively to nitrogen and phosphorous compounds. It is based on the flame ionization detector but differs in that it contains a rubidium or cesium silicate (glass) bead situated in a heater coil, a little distance from the hydrogen flame. If the detector is to respond to both nitrogen and phosphorous then the hydrogen flow should be minimal so that the gas does not ignite at the jet. If the detector is to respond to phosphorous only, a large flow of hydrogen is used which is burnt at the jet. The heated bead emits electrons by thermionic emission. These electrons are collected under a potential of a few volts by an appropriately placed anode, and provides a background current. When a solute containing nitrogen or phosphorous is eluted from the column, the partially combusted nitrogen and phosphorous materials are adsorbed on the surface of the bead. The adsorbed material reduces the work function of the surface and, as consequence, the emission of electrons is increased which raises the current collected at the electrode. The sensitivity of the detector to phosphorous is about 10-12 gram per ml and for nitrogen about 10-11 gram per ml at a signal to nose ratio of 2. The alkali bead as a finite life and needs regular replacement.	[]

OBI:0000494	liquid chromatography autosampler	Designed to perform capillary LC with injection of sample volumes ranging from nL to L.	[]
OBI:0000495	vacuum degasser	A degassing system used for degassing solvents in liquid chromatography. Dissolved gasses, usually nitrogen and oxygen from the air, tend to be evolved in the mobile phase as the pressure is reduced when the mobile phase leaves the liquid chromatography column and enters the detector. Gasses in the mobile phase in the detector can produce completely unacceptable noise and, thus, must be removed. The dissolved gasses were originally removed under vacuum but, unfortunately, are soon replaced if the solvent is left in contact with air at atmospheric pressure. For this reason degassing is now usually carried out by bubbling helium through the mobile phase reservoirs. Secondly, vacuum is used in the thermionic detector. This consists of a device, very similar in design to the thermionic valve which is attached to a vacuum and a small quantity of the eluent from a gas chromatography column allowed to bleed through it. Helium is used as the carrier gas. The presence of solute vapor causes the thermionic current to fall. This type of detector tends to become contaminated rather readily.	[]

OBI:0000506	photoionization detector	The selective determination of aromatic hydrocarbons or organo-heteroatom species is the job of the photoionization detector (PID). This device uses ultraviolet light as a means of ionizing an analyte exiting from a GC column. The ions produced by this process are collected by electrodes. The current generated is therefore a measure of the analyte concentration. f the amount of ionization is reproducible for a given compound, pressure, and light source then the current collected at the PID's reaction cell electrodes is reproducibly proportional to the amount of that compound entering the cell. The reason why the compounds that are routinely analyzed are either aromatic hydrocarbons or heteroatom containing compounds (like organosulfur or organophosphorus species) is because these species have ionization potentials (IP) that are within reach of commercially available UV lamps. The available lamp energies range from 8.3 to 11.7 ev, that is, lambda max ranging from 150 nm to 106 nm. Although most PIDs have only one lamp, lamps in the PID are exchanged depending on the compound selectivity required in the analysis.	["PID"]
OBI:0000507	gas generator	An instrument that generates gases for use with the gas chromatograph. Previously gas was obtained from gas tanks or gas cylinders. However, over the past decade the use of gas generators have become more popular as it avoids having gases at high pressure in the laboratory which is perceived by some as potentially dangerous. In addition, the use of a hydrogen generator avoids the use of a cylinder of hydrogen at high pressure which is also perceived by some as a serious fire hazard despite the fact that they have been used in laboratories, quite safely for nearly a century.

OBI:0000515	chromatofocusing column	A chromatofocusing column is a chromatography column in which a resin is equilibrated at one pH and eluted at a second pH.

OBI:0000521	flame ionization detector	A flame ionization detector is a GC detector that consist of a hydrogen/air flame and a collector plate which are normally heated independently of the chromatographic oven. Heating is necessary in order to prevent condensation of water generated by the flame and also to prevent any hold-up of solutes as they pass from the column to the flame. There is an electrode above the flame to collect the ions formed at a hydrogen/air flame. The number of ions hitting the collector is measured and a signal is generated. Flame ionization detectors are most widely used and generally applicable for gas chromatography and hence is used for routine and general purpose analysis. It is easy to use but destructive of the sample.	["FID"]

The use of solid phase extraction provides an efficient interface between chromatography and NMR with demands for special type of flow probes.	["flow HR-probe"]
OBI:0000528	liquid chromatography valve	A sample valve that must be able to sustain pressures up to 10,000 p.s.i., although it is most likely to operate on a continuous basis, at pressures of 3,000 p.s.i. or less. The higher the operating pressure the tighter the valve seating surfaces must be forced together to eliminate any leak. It follows that any abrasive material, however fine, that passes into the valve can cause the valve seating to become scored each time it is rotated which will ultimately lead to leaks. This will cause the sample size to vary between samples and eventually affect the accuracy of the analysis. It follows that any solid material must be carefully removed from any sample before filling the valve. The sample volume of an internal loop valve is situated in the connecting slot of the valve rotor and can be used only for relatively small sample volumes. Internal sample loop valves provide samples with volumes ranging from 0.1 ml to about 0.5 ml. Valve operation is shown in figure 6. The left-hand side diagram shows the load position. The sample occupies the rotor slot and has been filled by passing the sample from an appropriate syringe through the rotor slot to waste. While loading the sample, the mobile phase supply is passed through the valve directly to the column. To place the sample onto the column, the valve is then rotated and the valve slot containing the sample is now placed between the solvent supply and the column. As a result, the sample is passed into the column by the flow of solvent.	[]

OBI:0000536	fraction collector	A fraction detector is a device that allows regular or specified samples to be taken from a column eluate and stored in a retrievable form. The storage vessels are usually small sample tubes or vials that are oriented in a rotating disk or in a moving belt, there movement usually being controlled by a microprocessor. On receiving a signal from the microprocessor, the next vial is placed under the column outlet and the eluate collected until receiving another signal from the computer. Once the properties of the chromatogram that describes the separation has been ascertained, then the collection program can be defined. The fractions can be collected on a basis of time either at regular intervals or a specific times to collect specific peaks. Alternatively the fractions can be collected by monitoring the detector output and when a peak starts to elute the fraction collector is activated and the peak collected in a specific vial. When the peak returns to base line the column eluate is then directed to waste until the next peak starts eluting. Fraction collectors are in common use with most liquid chromatographs. They are used to collect samples for further purification, subsequent examination by spectroscopic techniques or for biological or organoleptic testing.	[]

OBI:0000538	in-line filter	A solvent filter that sits between the pump and the injection valve that prevents dust particles, general debris and, to some extent, bacteria from entering the chromatography system. Contaminants can interfere with the low-pressure gradient former or the pump and particles entering valves may interfere with the proper function.

OBI:0000553	Bruker Capillary LC-NMR platform	Capillary LC-NMR is a hyphenated technique coupling capillary liquid chromatography and NMR, which increases sensitivity dramatically through the use of miniaturization of the chromatographic techniques and NMR detection volume. LC-NMR hyphenated systems separate a mixture into its pure components and couple the output to NMR for automatic sample analysis. The ever increasing need to measure lower sample amounts and lower level impurities demands the highest NMR sensitivity. Traditional LC-NMR systems with relatively large peak volumes are not optimized for such low levels of detection. Bruker BioSpin, together with Waters and Protasis has developed a Capillary LC-NMR system.

OBI:0000565	electrical conductivity detector	The electrical conductivity detector measures the conductivity of the mobile phase. There is usually background conductivity which must be backed-off by suitable electronic adjustments. If the mobile phase contains buffers, the detector gives a base signal that completely overwhelms that from any solute usually making detection impossible. Thus, the electrical conductivity detector a bulk property detector. and senses all ions whether they are from a solute or from the mobile phase. In order to prevent polarization of the sensing electrodes, AC voltages must be used and so it is the impedance not the resistance of the electrode system that is actually measured. From a physical chemistry stand point the conductivity of a solution is more important than its resistance. However, it is the resistance (impedance) of the electrode system that determines the current across it. The resistance of any conductor varies directly as its length and inversely as its cross sectional area.	[]

OBI:0000568	piston-seal	The seal made by a piston in a diaphragm pump. The unique property of the reciprocating diaphragm pump is that the actuating piston does not come into direct contact with the mobile phase and thus, the demands on the piston-cylinder seal are not so great. The diaphragm has a relatively high surface area and thus, the movement of the diaphragm is relatively small and consequently the pump can be operated at a fairly high frequency. High frequency pumping results in a very significant reduction in pulse amplitude and, in addition, high frequency pulses are more readily damped by the column system. Nevertheless, it must be emphasized that diaphragm pumps are not pulseless.	[]

The refractive index detector is one of the least sensitive LC detectors. It is very sensitive to changes in ambient temperature, pressure changes, flow-rate changes and can not be used for gradient elution. Despite these many disadvantages, this detector is extremely useful for detecting those compounds that are nonionic, do not adsorb in the UV, and do not fluoresce. There are many optical systems used in refractive index detectors but one of the most common is the differential refractive index detector.	[]

OBI:0000588	flame photometric detector	The determination of sulfur or phosphorus containing compounds is the job of the flame photometric detector (FPD). This device uses the chemiluminescent reactions of these compounds in a hydrogen/air flame as a source of analytical information that is relatively specific for substances containing these two kinds of atoms. The emitting species for sulfur compounds is excited S2. The lambda max for emission of excited S2 is approximately 394 nm. The emitter for phosphorus compounds in the flame is excited HPO (lambda max = doublet 510-526 nm). In order to selectively detect one or the other family of compounds as it elutes from the GC column, an interference filter is used between the flame and the photomultiplier tube (PMT) to isolate the appropriate emission band. The drawback here being that the filter must be exchanged between chromatographic runs if the other family of compounds is to be detected.	["FPD"]

OBI:0000595	pulsed amperometric detector	A chromatography detector as used by high-performance anion exchange chromatography that provides sensitive and specific detection of carbohydrates. Pulsed Electrochemical Detection (PED) allows simple, sensitive, and direct detection of numerous polar aliphatic compounds, especially carbohydrates. This technique exploits the electrocatalytic activity of noble metal electrode surfaces to oxidize various polar functional groups. In PED, multi-step potential-time waveforms at Au and Pt electrodes realize amperometric/coulometric detection while maintaining uniform and reproducible electrode activity. The response mechanisms in PED are dominated by the surface properties of the electrode, and, as a consequence, members of each chemical class of compounds produce virtually identical voltammetric responses.

The conversion of nearly all nitrogen- and sulfur-containing compounds to their respective chemiluminescent species for universal nitrogen and sulfur detection has made nitrogen/sulfur chemiluminescence detection the most widely used analytical methods based upon ozone-induced chemiluminescence. In addition to non-chromatographic applications, nitrogen/sulfur chemiluminescence detection has been adapted to various chromatographic techniques from gas chromatography to liquid and supercritical fluid chromatography as specialized element-specific detectors.

In radial columns the packing is supported between two cylindrical frits and the gap between represents the bed height or column length. The outer frit is the column inlet and consequently the sample initially has a large area of stationary phase with which to interact. Frits are porous metal products to prevent unwanted particles from entering the chromatography system. These particles may come from the sample, the solvent or debris generated by the chromatography system itself. Such particles entering the system may lead to clogging of capillaries, interference with the chromatography by changing chromatographic parameters or disturbance of the detector function. Characteristics of a frit, besides the diameter and the thickness, is the porosity (pore distribution, density).	[]

To obtain monochromatic light an appropriate light filter would be needed.	[]
OBI:0000605	chart recorder	The chart recorder is a device that transduces signal-intensities into a graphical peak output: As the separated components of the gas sample emerge into the detector, the change in voltage in the detecting bridge circuit causes a representative peak to be drawn on a chart recorder. The position of the peak along the time axis of the chart measures the component's retention time, which identifies the component. This is directly related to carrier gas flow rate, temperature and column packing and dimensions. The area under each peak is proportional to the concentration of the component of the sample. The area of the peaks inscribed on the chart recorder can be determined by multiplying the height of the peak in mm, by the width of the peak in mm at 1/2 the peak height. The calibration curves for use with the chart recorder are therefore peak area plotted against concentration.	[]

This so-called Magic Angle Gradient is employed in Brukers high resolution Magic Angle Spinning (hr-MAS) probes, and is implemented in such a way that it is compatible with the stator and does not interfere with the sample eject or insert. Bruker BioSpin has developed a series of dedicated probes for standard bore magnets to accommodate the rapidly expanding field of hr-MAS.

OBI:0000642	atomic emission detector	Instead of measuring simple gas phase (carbon containing) ions created in a flame as with the flame ionization detector, or the change in background current because of electronegative element capture of thermal electrons as with the electron capture detector, the AED has a much wider applicability because it is based on the detection of atomic emissions. The strength of the AED lies in the detector's ability to simultaneously determine the atomic emissions of many of the elements in analytes that elute from a GC capillary column (called eluants or solutes in some books). As eluants come off the capillary column they are fed into a microwave powered plasma (or discharge) cavity where the compounds are destroyed and their atoms are excited by the energy of the plasma.

If the DNA-binding domain (bait) binds a potential DNA target site (prey) in vivo, it will recruit RNA polymerase to the promoter and activate transcription of the reporter genes in that clone. The two reporter genes, HIS3 and URA3, allow for positive and negative selections, respectively. At the end of the process, positive clones are sequenced and examined with motif-finding tools in order to resolve the favoured DNA target sequence	["B1H"]

OBI:0002177	patch clamp assay	An intracellular electrophysiology assay where a glass micropipette is sealed to the surface of the cell membrane as a recording electrode to study ion channel activity. The key distinction of this technique is the electrical resistance of the seal between the cell membrane and the pipette is of the order 10-100 gigaohms, permitting high-resolution current measurements over the cell membrane in several different standard configurations.	[]
OBI:0002178	whole-cell patch clamp assay	A patch-clamp assay where the electrode is left in place on the cell, as in cell-attached recordings, but the membrane patch has been perforated, providing access from the interior of the pipette to the intracellular space of the cell. Measurements made with this technique involve recording currents through multiple channels simultaneously, over the membrane of the entire cell.	[]
OBI:0002179	cell-attached patch clamp assay	A patch-clamp assay where the electrode is left in place on the cell, and the membrane patch has been left intact been perforated. This maintains the separation of the interior of the pipette to the intracellular space of the cell. Measurements made with this technique involve recording currents through multiple channels simultaneously, over the membrane of the entire cell.	[]
OBI:0002180	inside-out patch clamp assay	A patch-clamp assay where a patch of the membrane is attached to the patch pipette, detached from the rest of the cell, and the cytosolic surface of the membrane is exposed to the external media, or bath. This provides the experimenter has access to the intracellular surface of the membrane via the bath and can manipulate the environment at the intracellular surface of single ion channels. For example, channels that are activated by intracellular ligands can then be studied through a range of ligand concentrations.	[]
OBI:0002181	outside-out patch clamp assay	A patch-clamp assay where a patch of the membrane is attached to the patch pipette. In this configuration, the external surface of the cell membrane is exposed as the outside of the membrane patch relative to the patch electrode. An outside-out patch starts with a gigaohm seal in a whole-cell recording configuration. The electrode is slowly withdrawn from the cell, until a fragment of membrane bulges away from the cell, which detaches and reforms as a convex membrane on the end of the electrode, with the original external surface of the membrane facing outward from the electrode. This provides the experimenter with access to the extracellular surface of the membrane via the bath and can manipulate the environment at the extracellular surface of single ion channels.	[]
OBI:0002182	voltage clamp assay	An cellular electrophysiology assay where the membrane potential of a cell is controlled by the experimentalist. This is accomplished through a feedback mechanism where any change in membrane potential is countered by permitting electrical current to flow into or out of the cell.	[]
OBI:0002183	two electrode voltage clamp assay	The two electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) method utilizes two low-resistance pipettes, one sensing voltage and the other injecting current. The microelectrodes are filled with conductive solution and inserted into the cell to artificially control membrane potential. The membrane acts as a dielectric as well as a resistor, while the fluids on either side of the membrane function as capacitors. The microelectrodes compare the membrane potential against a command voltage, giving an accurate reproduction of the currents flowing across the membrane. Current readings can be used to analyze the electrical response of the cell to different applications. This technique is mainly used in the Oocyte preparation.	["TEVC"]
OBI:0002184	cut open oocyte voltage clamp assay	The cut-open oocyte Vaseline gap (COVG) voltage-clamp technique is designed to solve weaknesses in the two elextrode voltage clamp by maximizing the benefits of the Xenopus oocyte expression system by improving on clamp speed, signal-to-noise ratio, and ability to effectively perfuse the oocyte. In this way, it was possible to combine the most popular transient expression system, and the associated benefits of molecular cloning and site-directed mutagenesis, with the superior voltage-clamp properties of cut-open cell techniques.	["COVG"]
OBI:0002185	current clamp assay	The current clamp technique records the membrane potential by injecting current into a cell through the recording electrode. Unlike in the voltage clamp mode, where the membrane potential is held at a level determined by the experimenter, in \"current clamp\" mode the membrane potential is free to vary, and the amplifier records whatever voltage the cell generates on its own or as a result of stimulation. This technique is used to study how a cell responds when electric current enters a cell; this is important for instance for understanding how neurons respond to neurotransmitters that act by opening membrane ion channels.	[]
